# Popular Words API

Popular words API is an API based on Wikipediaâ€™s Most common words in English article available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English). The project was quickly made for fun.

This API uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and scrapes the article once every day to keep itself updated.
